# React Frontend

This is the frontend part of the project built using React. The frontend interacts with the backend Flask application for full functionality. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the React app locally.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn (Node package managers)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Folder**

   If you're not already in the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Once inside the `frontend` directory, install the required dependencies:

   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   After installing the dependencies, you can run the React application in development mode:
   
   Using npm:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```
